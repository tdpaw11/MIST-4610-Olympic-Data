## Scenario Description

The Olympic Games represent one of the most logistically complex events in the world, requiring precise coordination across a vast network of people, locations, and schedules.  Our team modeled a comprehensive relational database designed to manage the core operations of the Olympic Games.

This database tracks the hierarchical structure of global competition, starting from the participating **Countries** down to the individual **Athletes** and **Staff** members (such as coaches and medical trainers).  It efficiently schedules competitive **Events** (linked to their broader **Sports**) across various time blocks (**Sessions**) and physical **Venues**.  Furthermore, the model handles fan engagement by tracking **Spectators** and their **Ticket** purchases for specific sessions.  Finally, it securely logs the ultimate outcomes of the games by recording athlete **Results**, including scores, placements, disqualifications, and the specific **Medals** awarded.

## Data Model

### Explanation of the Data Model

Our data model consists of 14 unique entities:

* **Core Reference Data:** `Country`, `Venue`, `Sport`, `Medal`, and `Staff_Role`.  These lookup tables ensure data consistency and prevent entry anomalies (e.g., standardizing the 4 types of medals or standardizing IOC codes).

* **People & Roles:** The `Athlete` and `Staff` tables are linked to their respective `Country`.  To account for the reality that an athlete might have multiple coaches and a coach might train multiple athletes, we resolved this M:N relationship with the `Athlete_Staff` bridge table.

* **Scheduling Logistics:** Because an `Event` (like the 100m Sprint) spans multiple time blocks (heats, semi-finals, finals), and a `Session` can host multiple events, they are connected via the `Event_Session` bridge table.  `Sessions` are physically hosted at a single `Venue`.

* **Fan Access:** Fans (`Spectators`) purchase `Tickets` that grant them a specific seat and price point for a specific `Session`.

* **Outcomes:** The `Result` table acts as the ultimate transactional hub.  It connects an `Athlete`, an `Event`, and a `Medal` to record a finalized `ScoreOrTime`, `Placement`, and `IsDisqualified` flag.

**What our database supports:** Tracking current game rosters, managing multi-day event schedules, processing ticket revenue, and tallying current medal leaderboards.
**What our database does NOT support:** It does not store historical Olympic data from previous years, financial payroll for staff/athletes, or highly detailed in-game statistics (like possession time or individual lap splits).

## Data Dictionary

*(Below is a sample of our data dictionary.  Please see the full PDF/Excel file in the repository for all 14 tables).*
