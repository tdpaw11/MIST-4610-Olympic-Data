## Scenario Description

The Olympic Games represent one of the most logistically complex events in the world, requiring precise coordination across a vast network of people, locations, and schedules.  Our team modeled a comprehensive relational database designed to manage the core operations of the Olympic Games.

This database tracks the hierarchical structure of global competition, starting from the participating **Countries** down to the individual **Athletes** and **Staff** members (such as coaches and medical trainers).  It efficiently schedules competitive **Events** (linked to their broader **Sports**) across various time blocks (**Sessions**) and physical **Venues**.  Furthermore, the model handles fan engagement by tracking **Spectators** and their **Ticket** purchases for specific sessions.  Finally, it securely logs the ultimate outcomes of the games by recording athlete **Results**, including scores, placements, disqualifications, and the specific **Medals** awarded.

## Data Model

*[Olympic Relational Model](https://github.com/conhof27/MIST-4610-Olympic-Data/blob/5f5ecf40d849ed4d5f3df20fc15c5560b1c1ae6a/Olympic%20Relational%20Model.pdf)*

### Explanation of the Data Model

Our data model consists of 14 unique entities:

* **Core Reference Data:** `Country`, `Venue`, `Sport`, `Medal`, and `Staff_Role`.  These lookup tables ensure data consistency and prevent entry anomalies (e.g., standardizing the 4 types of medals or standardizing IOC codes).

* **People & Roles:** The `Athlete` and `Staff` tables are linked to their respective `Country`.  To account for the reality that an athlete might have multiple coaches and a coach might train multiple athletes, we resolved this M:N relationship with the `Athlete_Staff` bridge table.

* **Scheduling Logistics:** Because an `Event` (like the 100m Sprint) spans multiple time blocks (heats, semi-finals, finals), and a `Session` can host multiple events, they are connected via the `Event_Session` bridge table.  `Sessions` are physically hosted at a single `Venue`.

* **Fan Access:** Fans (`Spectators`) purchase `Tickets` that grant them a specific seat and price point for a specific `Session`.

* **Outcomes:** The `Result` table acts as the ultimate transactional hub.  It connects an `Athlete`, an `Event`, and a `Medal` to record a finalized `ScoreOrTime`, `Placement`, and `IsDisqualified` flag.

**What our database supports:** Tracking current game rosters, managing multi-day event schedules, processing ticket revenue, and tallying current medal leaderboards.
**What our database does NOT support:** It does not store historical Olympic data from previous years, financial payroll for staff/athletes, or highly detailed in-game statistics (like possession time or individual lap splits).

## Ten Advanced Queries

### Query 1: Total Medals by Country (Simple)
<img width="581" height="107" alt="Screenshot 2026-03-30 at 1 01 52 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/221683af-c035-40e1-b682-72830c30c22a" />

**Description:** 
Identifies which countries are performing the best overall by calculating the total number of medals won by their athletic delegation.
Query 1 allows managers or olympic fans to conscisely view the number of medals each country has been awarded. This is useful to assess which countries are in the lead by number of medals won. This allows country's olympic success to be compared and ranked in a simple manner, exlcuding factors other than event results. Query 1  allows a manager to analyze a country as a whole, including every event. This compares countries regardless of how many events they compete in but rather how they have competed in the olympics in its entirety.

### Query 2: Average Ticket Price per Sport (Simple)
